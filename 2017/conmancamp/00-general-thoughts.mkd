# CfgMgmtCamp.eu

- Held in Gent every year, the Monday/Tuesday after FOSDEM
- Gathering of developers from the configuration management community.
- No attendance fee.
- Not explicitly about open source, more about the problem of cfgmgmtcamp
- Annoying schedule format - doesn't work with Giggity
- I should learn about:
  - docker compose
  - minikube
  - libgrafana
  - sysdig
