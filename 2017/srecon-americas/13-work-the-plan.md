# Postmortems, working the plan

## Antipatterns
### Unbalanced AI plan
- Short term vs long term
- Balance both.
- You need to prevent trivial recurrence in the short term, and less trivial
  recurrence in the longer term.

### Fixing symptoms, not causes
- Looking at root cause data.
- Why are we not architecting graceful failure in the first place.

### Humans as a root cause
- Humans are bad at repetitive tasks.
- In particular bad at following instructions.
- Don't make people afraid to speak up.
- Remove the ability for humans to introduce errors.

### Balance action items # hmm.
- Detections


## Best practices
### Prioritise and classify the work
### Executive focus
### Reviews and reports

## Summary
- Balanced action item plans
- Concrete and actionable

## Questions
- Rhyming incidents
- What role is best placed to create AI plans?
  - Incident manager, someone else? Depends.
  - Should be one PM owner, should be someone who participated in the incident.
- Sticks - what about carrots?
  - Fixits. Gamify closing out postmortem action items.
- What about when you have an environment that's internal?
- How do you scale your postmortem with the size of the incident?
  - If you're OK with it happening again, then maybe no postmortem in right.
  - If you don't want to go into all of the details, that's fine. If those
    small things keep happening, reassess.
  - Maybe small stuff does a lightweight process?
- Do you do incident analysis of successes?
  - Project retrospective templates.
