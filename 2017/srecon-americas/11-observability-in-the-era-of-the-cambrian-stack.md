# Observability in the Era of the Cambrian Stack
- Monitoring and time-series metrics, log aggregators have improved and mature.
- Monitoring is a solved problem.
  - Debugging is not a solved problem.
- Don't monitor everything.
- We should do less monitoring and more instrumentation.
  - More debugging.
- Data driven debugging.
- Dashboards are for KPIs.
  - They're all for understanding the last outage. (and every outage for the
    last N years)
- Two times to debug a system
  - Look at a dashboard, see something broken.
- Dashboard blindness
  - If there's no dashboard, it doesn't exist.
- The future most be explorable
  - Ask a question and iterate on it, don't pregenerate stuff.
- Using splunk, indices.
  - "Why are you spending millions of dollars a year to run grep on your own
    logs?"
- START structuring your data
  - Why are we doing string processing server side?

## The future
- Structured data, flexible storage.
- Event driven.
- Event driven debugging.

## Single node debugging
- Who cares?

## The future
### Must cross barriers and boundaries

## We lose our history
- Where's our bash history for splunk and datadog?
- New things are cheap.
- Sharing is cheap.

### Must be human centred
- openlettermonitoring products
- Teaching ops to software engineers is the second wave of devops change.
- Ops and DBAs are rumored to exist on the other side of an API.

## Thef future belongs to those who are SWE-native
