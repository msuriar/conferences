## Assumptions
- Why diversity and inclusion are important
- That there is a problem

  - Not everyone will experience this in the same way.
- Inclusion is belonging
  - How people are treated when they're in the room.

## Herd immunity
- Inoculate/immunise the largest number of people possible.

### You
- Assume nothing.
- Broaden your horizons.
  - Spend time with people of different backgrounds, races, religions,
    socio-economic backgrounds.
  - Especially true of the tech industry.
  - Easy way: follow people who are not like you on Twitter.
- Listen to people and believe them when they tell you something that's wrong.
- Learn.
- Self correct.
  - I'm sorry. I realise that was wrong.

### Friends
- Marginalised people cannot get to the people who need this message.
- Everyone in the room respect the idea enough that you want to learn more.
- How do you reach people who aren't willing to be in the room.
- Encourage
  - Change habits. s/guys/folks/

### Employer
- Speaking up to your employer is important, particularly if you're privileged.
