# Foreman discovery
- Without logging MAC addresses, you say?

## The problem
- Bare metal.
- Write down MAC addresses, forget them, get them wrong.
   - Bleh.

- Change TFTP stack, "unknown" hardware boots to a ramdisk
- Collect information about the hardware, report it.
- On demand provisioning.
- Facter facts on new hosts.

## Questions
- Customisation of discovery image.
- How big is it?
   - Can you get GPXE on the disk as part of the discovery image?
